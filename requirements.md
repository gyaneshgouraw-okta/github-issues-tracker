# GitHub Issue Comment Tracker Requirements

## Project Overview
This application will track GitHub issues that have received comments after being closed. It follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern to maintain clean separation of concerns and ensure maintainability.

## Core Features
1. User authentication with GitHub token
2. Repository selection
3. Fetching and displaying closed issues with post-closure comments
4. Filtering and sorting capabilities
5. Persistent storage of user preferences and data

## Technical Requirements

### GitHub API Integration
- Utilize GitHub REST API v3 or GraphQL API v4
- Implement token-based authentication
- Efficiently fetch issues, comments, and related metadata
- Respect GitHub API rate limits

### User Interface
- Clean, responsive design using modern React patterns
- Intuitive navigation and interaction flows
- Loading states, error messages, and empty states
- Accessibility compliance

### MVVM Architecture
- **Models**: Data structures representing GitHub entities (repositories, issues, comments)
- **Views**: React components for UI rendering
- **ViewModels**: State management and business logic that connects views to models
- **Services**: API communication, data transformation, and persistence

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Setup and Authentication
- [x] Initialize React + Vite project
- [ ] Add essential dependencies (React Router, Axios, state management library)
- [ ] Setup project structure following MVVM pattern
- [ ] Create GitHub API service module
- [ ] Implement authentication flow with GitHub token
- [ ] Build repository selection component

### Phase 2: Core Functionality
- [ ] Create models for GitHub entities
- [ ] Develop ViewModels for data fetching and transformation
- [ ] Implement API service for fetching closed issues
- [ ] Add logic to identify issues with post-closure comments
- [ ] Build UI components for displaying issues and comments
- [ ] Add filtering and sorting capabilities

### Phase 3: User Experience and Polish
- [ ] Implement data persistence for user preferences
- [ ] Add loading states and error handling
- [ ] Create responsive layouts for different device sizes
- [ ] Optimize performance for large repositories
- [ ] Implement pagination for large result sets

### Phase 4: Testing and Documentation
- [ ] Write unit tests for core functionality
- [ ] Add integration tests for API services
- [ ] Document code and architecture
- [ ] Create user guide for the application
- [ ] Perform final review and bug fixes
