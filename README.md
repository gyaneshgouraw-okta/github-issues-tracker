## Requirements

- Node.js 14.0 or newer
- GitHub account with personal access token
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## Application Structure

The application follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern:

### Models

- Located in `/src/models/`
- Define data structures and types for GitHub entities
- Handle data validation and transformation

### Views

- Located in `/src/views/`
- React components that render the UI
- Separated into pages and reusable components

### ViewModels

- Located in `/src/viewmodels/`
- Connect models to views
- Manage application state and business logic
- Handle data processing and transformation

### Services

- Located in `/src/services/`
- Encapsulate API calls and external integrations
- Manage GitHub API communication

## API Integration

The application uses the GitHub REST API v3 to:

1. Verify user authentication
2. Fetch user repositories
3. Get closed issues from repositories
4. Retrieve issue comments
5. Compare issue closed date with comment creation dates

Rate limiting is automatically handled to prevent API usage limits.

## Authentication

Authentication is implemented using GitHub personal access tokens, which provides:

- Secure access to GitHub APIs
- No need to store user passwords
- Fine-grained permission control
- Ability to revoke access at any time

Tokens are stored securely in the browser's localStorage for persistence between sessions.
